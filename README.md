Human can't predict the future! What's emergence truth now it may be failed soon. Don't need to show excuse! Just, failure is only mine. Be always ready to take the greatest challenge ever you didn't face. **Show what u did then what u know.**
Experience > Implementation > Imagination > Knowledge > Education

Use tool what you know the best where you and your team is comfortable with that and run with that. Because since you can't be sure of what you're building whatever tool that you pick is going be badly adapted for what you're doing. 

Ideas don't come out fully formed. They only become clear as you work on them. You just have to get started.

**Remember:** Get started is easy but doing something great is actually difficult.
