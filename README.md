# Philosophy
Human can't predict the future! What's emergence truth now it may be failed soon. Don't need to show excuse! Just, failure is only mine. Be always ready to take the greatest challenge ever you didn't face. **Show what u did then what u know.**
#### Experience > Implementation > Imagination > Knowledge > Education ####

Build first
-----------
You need to build something before you know what you are building! Use tool what you know the best where you and your team is comfortable with that and run with that. Because since you can't be sure of what you're building whatever tool that you pick is going be badly adapted for what you're doing.
